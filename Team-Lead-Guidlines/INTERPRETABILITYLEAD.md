## 2. Your Role

**Position:** Lead of Machine Learning Mechanistic Interpretability 
**Department:** Machine Learning 
**Reports To:** Jay Damodaran - ML co-lead, Vivek Beeram - ML co-lead, Nathan Feldt - Software Lead  

**Purpose of the Role:**  
As the Lead of Mechanistic Interpretability, your focus is on the interpretability of machine learning models and using this as a way of continuous improvement. You will guide your team to develop tools that inform how models make decisions and enhance their performance and reliability.

## 3. Team Structure

**Your Team Members:**

- Your team will consist of around 5-10 people with varying levels of experience in machine learning. 

**Collaborations:**

- **ML Teams 1 & 2 Leads:** These teams are responsible for the development of machine learning models. 
- **Signals and ML Integration Team:** This team is responsible for signal processing and feature extraction along with integrating signals into online ML applications.
- **Interface Design Team:** This team is responsible for interface design. Could be utilized to help develop interpretability visualizations

---

## 4. Key Responsibilities

### Leadership and Management

- **Mentorship:** Support team members in understanding model interpretability tools and conceptual understandings of model behavior.
- **Task Coordination:** Utilize team members to evenly and effectively complete desired tasks
- **Leadership:** Our goal is to encourage team members to take ownership in some aspect of the project. The philosophy behind this is to lighten the load of the team leads and allow the members to build a greater connection to the larger project. 

### Collaboration

- **Feedback Loop:** We envision that you will communicate with ML teams 1 & 2 fairly frequently. Your findings will be invaluable to these teams and hopefully allow them to improve their current implementations.
- **Research and Development:** R & D has the goal of developing new models or methods within machine learing. Whether collaboration is active or passive, it is highly encouraged.


### Member Engagement and Learning

- **Task Assignment:** Continuously there will be tasks that require completion. As a team lead it is your responsibility that those tasks are well defined and assigned to the appropriate person.
- **Skill Development:** It is the team leads responsibility that they provide the appropriate resources to help each member understand their assignments and how it fits into the larger project. Powerpoints, Jupyter Notebooks, and 1-1s have been used in the past but the approach you take is up to you.

## 5. Current Project: EEG-Controlled Prosthetic Hand

**Project Overview:**  
Your team will focus on interpreting the machine learning models developed by Teams 1 & 2, ensuring they are reliable, explainable, and optimized for real-world application.

**Your Team's Focus Areas:**

- **Model Explainability:** Apply techniques like SHAP values or LIME to understand model outputs. Other techniques are up the lead's discretion.
- **Reliability:** Understand how the model generalizes. Where does the model fail to generalize? Why?
- **Optimization:** Based on your findings, generate implementations that improve our models. 

**Key Milestones:**

1. **4 weeks:** Familiarize with existing models and complete team onboarding. Begin basic model interpretability. Provide short report on findings regarding generalization and key features in the data.
2. **8 weeks:** Provide detailed interpretability reports and suggest improvements. Begin implementing and possibly testing model changes.
3. **End of semester:** Collaborate on implementing optimizations and validate enhancements.

---

## 6. Tools and Resources

- **Programming Languages:** Python, with libraries like NumPy and Pandas
- **Interpretability Tools:** SHAP, LIME, Grad-CAM, ELI5, etc.
- **Version Control:** GitHub for tracking changes and collaboration
- **Collaboration Platforms:** Slack for team communication, Github for software documentation, and OneNote for general team documentation and Logs
- **Computational Resources:** Currently work in progress

---

## 7. Policies and Procedures

- **Documentation:** Keep comprehensive records of methodologies and findings. Documentation should not only provide information on how to use the application but should also allow the user to learn from it.
