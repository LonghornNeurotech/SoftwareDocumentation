This folder has a list of several data augmentation techniques for eeg data. 
There is no need to understand everything. 
Some of these papers are quite dense. 
Definitely, skim through the papers to get a general overview of what's going on. 
If I have the time, I will upload a notebook showing the implementation of some of these techniques. 
These techniques are useful because they help ml models generalize better when you have limited data, 
which is very much the case with eeg data.
