    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Explanation**:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Filtering Requires Past Data**:\n",
    "  - Filters, especially IIR filters like Butterworth, have memory; they rely on previous input values.\n",
    "- **Warm-up Period**:\n",
    "  - When applying filters, the initial outputs may not be reliable due to lack of prior data.\n",
    "- **Sufficient Data for Stable Filtering**:\n",
    "  - Having a larger buffer (10 seconds) ensures that the filter has enough past data to produce stable and accurate filtered signals.\n",

    "for i in range(len(self.eeg_channels)):\n",
    "    # Process channel i\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Explanation**:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Independent Signals**:\n",
    "  - EEG channels represent different electrodes placed on the scalp, each measuring local electrical activity.\n",
    "- **Unique Signal Characteristics**:\n",
    "  - Each channel may have different noise levels, artifacts, and signal characteristics.\n",
    "- **Avoiding Cross-Channel Contamination**:\n",
    "  - Processing channels separately prevents mixing signals, which could corrupt the data.\n",
    "- **Channel-Specific Filters**:\n",
    "  - Allows for individual adjustments if certain channels require different processing in the future.\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Explanation**:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Filter Statefulness**:\n",
    "  - Filters like the IIR Butterworth filter are stateful, meaning their output depends on previous inputs.\n",
    "- **Continuous Filtering**:\n",
    "  - By applying the filter to the entire buffer, we maintain continuity in the filtered signal.\n",
    "- **Avoiding Edge Effects**:\n",
    "  - Filtering only the new data would introduce artifacts at the boundaries due to abrupt changes.\n",
    "- **Consistency**:\n",
    "  - Ensures that each data point is filtered only once and maintains temporal consistency in the signal.\n",
    "\n",

    "time.sleep(2)  # Wait until we can fill the buffer (why?)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Explanation**:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Buffer Warm-up**:\n",
    "  - Allows the raw data buffer to accumulate enough data (at least 2 seconds worth).\n",
    "- **Stable Filtering**:\n",
    "  - Ensures that when we start filtering, the buffer has sufficient past data for the filters to operate correctly.\n",
    "- **Preventing Initial Artifacts**:\n",
    "  - Starting processing immediately might result in unreliable outputs due to insufficient data for the filters.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Processing Data 10 Times per Second\n",

    "sleep_time = max(0, 0.1 - elapsed_time)\n",
    "time.sleep(sleep_time)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Explanation**:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Real-Time Responsiveness**:\n",
    "  - Updating 10 times per second (every 100 ms) provides a good balance between responsiveness and computational load.\n",
    "- **Human Perception**:\n",
    "  - Visual or feedback systems updating at 10 Hz appear smooth to human observers.\n",
    "- **Data Overlap**:\n",
    "  - With a window size of 1.5 seconds and updates every 0.1 seconds, there's significant overlap between consecutive data windows.\n",
    "- **Sufficient for Many Applications**:\n",

    "## Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we've explored how to process EEG data in real-time using Python and BrainFlow. We've covered:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Initialization**: Setting up the EEG data stream and buffers.\n",
    "- **Filtering**: Applying bandpass and notch filters to clean the signal.\n",
    "- **Normalization**: Standardizing the data using z-score normalization.\n",
    "- **Buffer Management**: Maintaining and trimming data buffers to ensure efficiency.\n",
    "- **Processing Loop**: Implementing a loop that processes data at a suitable rate for real-time applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "Understanding the reasoning behind each step is crucial for developing effective EEG data processing pipelines, especially when dealing with real-time requirements.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "**Next Steps**:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Integrate with Real EEG Devices**: Replace the synthetic board with actual EEG hardware.\n",
    "- **Implement Advanced Processing**: Explore techniques like artifact removal, feature extraction, or machine learning models.\n",
    "- **Visualize the Data**: Use libraries like Matplotlib or PyQtGraph to visualize the EEG signals in real-time.\n",
    "- **Optimize Performance**: For higher data rates or more complex processing, consider optimizing the code or using multi-threading.\n",
